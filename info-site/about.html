		<span>I'm Matt Rueter. Over the past 14 months I've retrained as a web developer. 
			I am self-taught, primarily following the curriculum The Odin Project. A highly recommendable course 
			which emphasises problem solving and continual learning. Demanding and motivating, it has helped me 
			to learn tools, skills and best practices. All of which I'm sure I still need to imporve and am doing so.
	  	</span>
		<span>I am able to write programs with confidence using JS, React.js while making use of 
			Jest for testing, Webpack for bundling and GIT for version control. I do all of this on either VS Code 
			while making use of the Linux CLI. I am always trying to improve my abilities with these. At the moment 
			I am also learning Node.js React-testing-library and TypeScript. On the side for fun, I am learning the 
			basics of Python as well as learning about Data Structures and Algorithims in computer science.</span>
